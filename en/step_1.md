### Creating a new Scratch variable

A variable is a named place to store data. Variables are really useful for storing all sorts of things, for example each player's score in a game, the speed of an object or how many lives a player has left.

+ Click on "Data" in the scripts tab then click on "Make a variable"

+ Type in the name of your variable. You can choose whether you would like your variable to be available to all sprites, or to only this sprite. Press OK.

+ Once you have created the variable it will be displayed on the stage, or you can untick the variable in the scripts tab to hide it. New blocks will appear to allow you to change the value of the variable.
